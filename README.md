# Hands-On Learning Project Documentation


## Introduction

This project focuses on detecting and recognizing several different hand gestures using the YOLOv5 deep learning model. The hand gestures include "hello," "perfect," "I love you," "G," "T, "eat", "Love", and "no."

## Project Overview

The Hands-On Learning project utilizes the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) object detection architecture created by Ultralytics to detect and classify hand gestures in images or videos in real-time. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its accuracy and speed.

## Hand Gestures

The following 8 hand gestures are included in the dataset:

1. **Hello**: A waving hand gesture.
2. **Perfect**: A hand gesture signifying perfection with the thumb and forefinger forming a circle.
3. **I Love You**: A hand gesture representing "I love you" in sign language, with the pinky, index finger, and thumb extended.
4. **G**: A hand gesture indicating the letter G.
5. **T**: A hand gesture indicating the letter T.
6. **Eat**: A hand gesture pressing all fingers together to the mouth.
7. **Love**: A hand gesture crossing your arms across the body with closed fists.
8. **No**: A hand gesture for indicating negation or disagreement with a shaking motion.
